This is a repository for Skip contributor licence agreements (CLAs) handling.

The CLAs are handled by [cla-bot](https://colineberhardt.github.io/cla-bot/), which will check for the presence of the contributors name in the `.clabot` file.

## Add user

If you accept the Skip
[CLA](Contributor-License-Agreement.md),
***please add your GitHub username to the `.clabot` file*** and create a PR in this repo.

When the PR is merged, the cla-bot can be triggered again with a `@cla-bot recheck` comment.
